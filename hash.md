# Hash
### Base64
Base64 is a group of similar binary-to-text encoding schemes that represent binary data in an ASCII string format by translating it into a radix-64 (6 bits) representation (1 char representation 1 byte). 

Example, how many chars of base64 to represent 6 Billion numbers?
$$
\lceil\log_{64}{6e9}\rceil = \lceil5.4\rceil = 6
$$

#### Bytes and scale
* 1M (million): 1MB
* 1B (million): 1GB
* 1T (trillion): 1TB
